Prerequisite: Java8, Maven3+

This is demo project to illustrate how to create a distribution assembly which is ready to run at anywhere. Here we have used maven's
assembly plugin to build distribution and spring boot thin layout plugin to make it ready to ship and ready to run.
Follow below steps to launch the microservices:

1) ~ cd springboot-distribution-assembly
2) mvn clean install package (This may take time as it ll resolve all the dependencies.)
3) This will build a distribution @ /springboot-distribution-assembly/distribution/target/distribution-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
   This distribution is not ready to run yet as it doesn't have any of your native or thirdparty dependencies.
4) To do so run below commands
   ~cd /springboot-distribution-assembly/distribution/target/distribution-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
   ~java -jar first-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --thin.dryrun --thin.root=.
   ~java -jar second-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --thin.dryrun --thin.root=.
   
   * --thin.dryrun this will warm up maven repository local to your distribution. You can find all your dependencies 
   		in distribution-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/repository
   * --thin.root=. Make sure to out . which will refer to current directory and create repository in distribution.
   
   * You can write shell script to warm up repository for all services at once. Refer /distribution-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/dryRun.sh

5) Now you can zip this distribution and ship it anywhere and start the services
	
	~java -jar first-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --thin.root=.
    ~java -jar second-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --thin.root=.
    
6) 	This will launch both the microservice. You can use swagger doc for services:
	http://localhost:8110/first/swagger-ui.html
	http://localhost:8111/second/swagger-ui.html
