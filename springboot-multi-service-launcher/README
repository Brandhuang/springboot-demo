This is demo project to illustrate how to run multiple microservices in single JVM
Follow below steps to launch the microservices:
1) cd springboot-multi-service-launcher
2) mvn clean install  (This may take time as it ll resolve all the dependencies.)
3) To run all microservices (first-service and second-service at once)
	~ cd launcher
	~ mvn exec:java OR mvn springboot:run
	
	This will launch both the microservice in single java process. You can use swagger doc for services:
	http://localhost:8110/first/swagger-ui.html
	http://localhost:8111/second/swagger-ui.html
	
	You can change ports here /launcher/src/main/resources/application.yml
	
4) You can also start individual microservice as different java processes
	~ cd first-service
	~ mvn springboot:run 
	
	You can change ports here /first-service/src/main/resources/application-dev.yml
	
	~ cd second-service
	~ mvn springboot:run 
	
	You can change ports here /second-service/src/main/resources/application-dev.yml
