Prerequisite: Java8, Maven3+

This is demo project to illustrate how to monitor health, memory usage and many other metrics for 
Spring Boot Applications

1) ~ cd springboot-sample-actuator
2) mvn clean install
3) mvn springboot:run
4) This will launch both the microservice. You can use swagger doc for services:
	http://localhost:8110/demo/swagger-ui.html

Monitoring endpoints:
----------------------
Once started you will get number of endpoints available for you for monitoring purpose
http://localhost:8110/demo/swagger-ui.html#/operation-handler


Here are some of the useful endpoints:
http://localhost:8110/demo/actuator/threaddump
http://localhost:8110/demo/actuator/beans
http://localhost:8110/demo/actuator/env
http://localhost:8110/demo/actuator/httpstrace
http://localhost:8110/demo/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.max
http://localhost:8110/demo/actuator/metrics/jvm.threads.live


By default Spring Boot exports metrics to JMX domain. And you have explicitly enalble the endpoints:
Please refer application-dev.yml:
//////////////////////////////////
management.metrics.export.jmx:
    domain: com.rmz.actuator
    enabled: true
    step: 1m

management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: "*"
    jmx:
      exposure:
        include: "*"
///////////////////////////////////

You can use JConsole for graphical view of all the metrics by connecting to com.rmz.actuator this domain.
